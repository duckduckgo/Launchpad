Version 0.1
This is just a sample version, it is not at all ready for production use.
Here's what it does so far:
1. Downloads the 'all projects' page
2. Parses it to collect useable information about each project

Here's what it doesn't to:
1. Load extra project info
2. Go through the rest of the pages

NOTE: Soon, this will probably be completely rewritten to use launchpadlib, but that has not been decided yet, as launchpadlib appears to be slower and uses more bandwidth.
