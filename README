Here's what it does so far:
1. Downloads the 'all projects' page
2. Parses it to collect useable information about each project
3. Goes through the rest of the pages

Here's what it doesn't to:
1. Load extra project info

the info that it does get:
project name
link
description
author's name
author's launchpad page
