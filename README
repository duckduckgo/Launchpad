1. Downloads the 'all projects' page
2. Parses it to collect useable information about each project
3. Goes through the rest of the pages

Here's what it doesn't do:
1. Load extra project info

the info that it does get:
project name

    -v          Be very verbose
    -testicon   exit after the first project icon is found and print extra information about it
