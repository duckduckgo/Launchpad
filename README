Here's what it does so far:
1. Downloads the 'all projects' page
2. Parses it to collect useable information about each project

4. Goes through the rest of the pages

How to run:
    $ python lpscraper.py
You can also add the following options:
    -v          Be very verbose
    -testicon   exit after the first project icon is found and print extra information about it
